BruteForceDomainSearch
======================

Brute Force Domain Search


Of note this is "brute force" and is likely to get you banned ten ways from Sunday!  Do not ever run this script as it will destroy your computer and set fire to whatever dwelling you currently inhabit!
You've been warned
Not much to see here, does what it says on the tin , e.g.

$ perl bruteforcedomainsearch.pl

Please type in how many letters you want to start with: 2

Please type in how many letters you want to test in DNS: 10

Please type in the top level domain you'd like to brute force [i.e. .com].com

and then it will start dumping out available domain names into STDOUT and /tmp/domlog
