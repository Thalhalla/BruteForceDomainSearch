BruteForceDomainSearch
======================

Brute Force Domain Search

Not much to see here, does what it says on the tin , e.g.

$ perl bruteforcedomainsearch.pl
Please type in how many letters you want to start with: 2
Please type in how many letters you want to test in DNS: 10
Please type in the top level domain you'd like to brute force [i.e. .com].com

and then it will start dumping out available domain names into STDOUT and /tmp/domlog
